# sql-challenge

Attached are resources that will allow you to take a look into employee files from the 1980's and 1990's. This consists of 6 csv files, which were then organized in a database to investigate a series of questions through queries. A schemas.sql and queries.sql file were created to help guide you through database creation and the previously mentioned questions.

Before proceeding, please review the entity relationship diagram below to better understand the data presented:

## Database creation instructions:

**Step 1 -** Create an empty database.

**Step 2 -** Open the schema.sql file (located in the Employees SQL folder), and run each of the rows.

**Step 3 -** Import csvs from the data folder, in the following order, into each of the tables that were created from the schema:

- departments
- titles
- employees
- dept_manager
- salaries
- dept_emp

**Step 4** - The database is now complete and analysis questions can be run from the query.sql file (also located from the EmployeesSQL folder). Run each block of code, corresponding to the question paired with it.
